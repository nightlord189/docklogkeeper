## Features
- Persistent storage of your Docker logs.
- Simple search in your logs' historical data.
- Access logs from any Docker container, regardless of its status (active or terminated).
- Simple cookie-based authorization.
- Log rotation: by default, older logs are pruned after a span of 1 week.

When DockLogKeeper could be right choice for you?
+ You manage multiple Docker containers on the same host.
+ Your containers don't generate millions of logs each day.

    ```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3010. Authenticate using the username **admin** and the password specified in step 1.
3. Explore and search your logs via an user-friendly interface.
